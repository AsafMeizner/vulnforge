# Data model — sync categories

Every table in VulnForge falls into one of three categories, determined by where its data can legitimately live.

## Category A — Syncable (with 3-tier scope)

Rows carry 7 sync columns. Each row picks a visibility scope.

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `sync_id` | TEXT UNIQUE | ULID minted at write time (sortable, globally unique) |
| `sync_scope` | TEXT | `private` / `team` / `pool` |
| `owner_user_id` | INTEGER | Who created it (solo mode: id=1 hardcoded) |
| `updated_at_ms` | INTEGER | Client write clock (informational) |
| `server_updated_at_ms` | INTEGER | Server write clock (ordering authority) |
| `tombstone` | INTEGER | `0` / `1` — soft-delete marker |
| `sync_status` | TEXT | `local` / `pending` / `synced` / `conflict` |

Tables in this category:

```
projects        vulnerabilities    scan_findings   pipeline_runs
notes           session_state      reports         checklists
checklist_items scans
```

`SYNCABLE_TABLES` in `server/sync/model.ts` is the single source of truth.

## Category B — Strictly per-machine (never sync)

Hold local filesystem paths, API keys, refresh tokens, UI prefs — meaningless or dangerous on another machine.

```
plugins            on-disk binaries and paths
notes_providers    vault paths, OAuth tokens
ai_providers       local API keys (see also Category C for server version)
integrations       local OAuth tokens (see also Category C)
api_tokens         long-lived MCP client tokens
refresh_tokens     NEVER leave their device
sync_outbox        client-only pending pushes
sync_cursors       client-only per-table cursor state
audit_log          server-only (desktop writes locally only)
sandbox_snapshots  local VM/container state
```

`UNSYNCABLE_TABLES` in `server/sync/model.ts` lists every Category B table; the transport guard rejects any attempt to sync them.

## Category C — Server-proxied capabilities

`ai_providers` and `integrations` are special: they exist independently on the desktop (user's own keys) AND on the server (team-shared keys). The server publishes them as **named capabilities** via the manifest sent on WebSocket connect. Clients see capability names + supported actions, not secrets.

When a client picks a `Server: ...` capability:
- AI invocation → `POST /api/server/ai/invoke` with `{capability, task, payload}`.
- Integration action → `POST /api/server/integrations/:name/:action`.

The server runs the actual upstream call with its own creds and streams the response back. Per-user RBAC (`ai:use`, `integrations:use`) gates manifest visibility.

## Scope semantics

- `private` — lives on the desktop only. Even in team mode, never serialized to the sync wire.
- `team` — all authenticated team members see it. Most rows in most workflows end up here.
- `pool` — opt-in, anonymized, crosses organizational boundaries. Separate endpoint (`/api/pool/push`), anonymization map, 1-hour snapshot cache on reads.

Setting: `settings.default_row_scope` (default: `private`). Users can override per-row via the scope pill in the row UI.

## Migration notes

The 7 sync columns were added to existing tables via idempotent `ALTER TABLE` statements in `migrateSchema()` (`server/db.ts`). Existing rows were backfilled with fresh ULIDs, `Date.now()`, and `sync_scope='private'` — so existing installs continue to function as solo-only without any data exposure.
